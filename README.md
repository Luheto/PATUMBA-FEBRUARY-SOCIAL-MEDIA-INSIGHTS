# SOCIAL MEDIA PERFORMANCE & CUSTOMER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
Analyzed February 2025 social media metrics and customer queries to quantify engagement, identify primary complaints, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer trust and content strategy.

## Questions this Analysis was Answering
- Performance & Growth:

How many people are we reaching (impressions) and how are they engaging (interactions, follows)?

Is our social media audience growing?

- Customer Service & Issues:

What are customers contacting us about?

What is the single biggest complaint?

How efficiently are we resolving these queries (TAT)?

- Customer Sentiment & Loyalty:

How satisfied are our customers (NPS)?

What are the common themes in their feedback?

- Content Strategy:

Are people just seeing our content, or are they actually engaging with it?

What is the gap between visibility and interaction?

## Process & Steps Taken
- Data Collection: Aggregated data from social media platform insights (Meta Business Suite, X Analytics, or similar) and customer service logs (likely from a CRM or helpdesk software).

- Data Processing: Categorized raw customer queries into three main types: Complaints, Enquiries, and General Queries.

- Complaint Analysis: Further classified complaints into specific sub-categories (e.g., "Pending transaction") and quantified their frequency.

- Performance Calculation: Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) like Page Impressions, Interactions, and Turn-Around Time (TAT) for query resolution.

- Sentiment Analysis: Manually analyzed and categorized a sample of customer comments to calculate a Net Promoter Score (NPS).

- Synthesis & Visualization: Compiled the analysis into a clear, visual report to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders.

## Outcomes
- High Visibility, Moderate Engagement: The content reached a wide audience (36,200 post views, 3,300 page impressions) but had a low engagement rate relative to its reach.

- Primary Customer Pain Point: "Pending transaction/Account not updated" was the dominant complaint, representing over 60% of all issues, indicating a significant operational problem impacting customer trust.

- Service Efficiency: The average time to resolve a query was 26.93 hours, with some cases taking the full 72-hour SLA, highlighting an area for process improvement.

- Ambiguous Metrics: The analysis uncovered unclear reporting terms (e.g., "NDS"), suggesting a need for better internal data governance.

## Recommendations
- Address Critical Operational Issues: Prioritize fixing the root cause of transaction and account update delays. This is the single most important action to reduce complaints and rebuild trust.

- Boost Engagement with Interactive Content: Shift content strategy towards polls, quizzes, and clear call-to-actions to convert passive viewers into active engagers.

- Improve Reporting Clarity: Standardize metrics and terminology across reports (e.g., clearly define "NDS") to ensure all stakeholders have a unified understanding of performance.

- Expand Feedback Analysis: Implement a more systematic approach to analyzing all customer comments, not just a sample, to better understand sentiment and uncover emerging issues.
